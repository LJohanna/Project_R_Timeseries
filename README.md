# Project_R_Timeseries
Future values prediction of the time series of the gross index of production of computers and peripheral equipment in France from 1990 to 2017.

Firstly, we had to stationarize the time series, in order to fit an ARMA model. With the ARMA model's help, we predicted the two next values of the time series and built confidence intervals for these values.
